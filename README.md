#This Todo app was created using React based on a Traversy Media tutorial video.
#An addition to the original tutorial that the Date input is an actual date-time picker.
#The date is shown in a custom format.
#Animation was added to the components using Framer Motion.

#Future features to be added:
#-countdown
#-task description (areatext)
#-delete on swipe
#-filtering options
#-add a simple back-end to the project that would handle the tasks
